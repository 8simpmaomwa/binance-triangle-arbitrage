# How to Play Electronic Battleship with Code Book
 
Electronic Battleship is a fun and exciting board game that simulates naval warfare. You and your opponent each have a fleet of five ships that you need to program into the computer console and then try to sink each other's ships by firing missiles. The game has four different modes, each with its own rules and challenges. To play Electronic Battleship, you need a code book that contains 100 computer-selected location patterns for your ships. Here's how to use the code book and play the game.
  
## What You Need
 
- An Electronic Battleship game unit with two computer consoles, a target grid divider, 10 plastic ships, 84 white pegs, 42 red pegs, and a battery door.
- Four AA batteries (not included).
- An Electronic Battleship code book (included).
- A pen and paper (optional).

## How to Set Up

1. Slide the target grid divider into the base unit so it is positioned between the two computer consoles.
2. Separate the 10 plastic ships from the runner. Each player's fleet contains five different ships: a carrier (5 holes), a battleship (4 holes), a cruiser (3 holes), a submarine (3 holes), and a destroyer (2 holes).
3. Each player takes two runners of white pegs (84 of them) and one runner of red pegs (42 of them). Separate pegs from runners and place them in the peg storage compartment. Discard runners.
4. Carefully remove the battery holder from the battery compartment and insert the four batteries as shown in the manual. Match the (+ and -) symbols on the batteries with the (+ and -) symbols located on the holder. Place holder back into compartment and attach the battery door.
5. Press the green ON button to turn on the game unit. It should play a short tune and then announce "Prepare for battle" and "Select game".

## How to Program Your Ships
 
You can program your ships' locations manually or use the code book for instant programming. Manual programming allows you to choose where to place your ships on your ocean grid, while instant programming lets you select one of the 100 pre-programmed patterns from the code book.

### Manual Programming

1. Select game mode 1, 2, or 3 by pressing one of the yellow buttons on your console. Game mode 4 is for instant programming only.
2. The computer will announce "Player 1 enter ship size". Player 1 presses one of the yellow buttons to enter the size of their first ship. For example, press button 5 for carrier, button 4 for battleship, etc.
3. The computer will announce "Enter coordinates". Player 1 presses one of the letter buttons (A-J) and one of the number buttons (1-10) to enter the starting coordinate of their ship. For example, press A5 for row A column 5.
4. The computer will announce "Enter direction". Player 1 presses one of the direction buttons (N, S, E, W) to enter the direction of their ship. For example, press E for east.
5. The computer will confirm the ship's location by announcing "Carrier A5 east". If correct, player 1 presses ENTER. If incorrect, player 1 presses CLEAR and repeats steps 2-4.
6. The computer will announce "Player 2 enter ship size". Player 2 repeats steps 2-5 for their first ship.
7. Players alternate programming their ships until all five ships are entered.

### Instant Programming

1. Select game mode 4 by pressing button 4 on your console.
2. The computer will announce "Player 1 select pattern". Player 1 opens the code book and chooses one of the 100 patterns. Each pattern has a three-digit code number.
3. Player 1 enters the code number by pressing three number buttons on their console. For example, press 0-3-6 for pattern 036.
4. The computer will confirm the pattern by announcing "Pattern 8cf37b1e13
