Opus Planet is a software that aims to facilitate and optimize the management of construction projects. It is a tool that can help users save time and money, improve quality and productivity, and comply with regulations and standards. Opus Planet is a software that has been used by thousands of professionals in the construction sector in Mexico and other countries.

Opus Planet is not only a software for managing construction projects, but also a software that supports the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. BIM is a process that involves creating and managing digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of buildings and infrastructure. BIM can help improve collaboration, coordination, communication, and efficiency among different stakeholders involved in a construction project.
 
Some of the benefits of using Opus Planet with BIM are:

- It allows users to create and edit 3D models of buildings and structures, as well as generate 2D drawings and documents.
- It enables users to perform simulations and analyses of various aspects of a project, such as cost, time, energy, sustainability, safety, and quality.
- It facilitates the integration and interoperability of different software and platforms, such as Revit, Navisworks, SketchUp, and Trimble Connect.
- It supports the implementation of standards and best practices for BIM, such as ISO 19650 and PAS 1192.
- It helps users to comply with regulations and requirements for BIM, such as Level 2 BIM in the UK.

Opus Planet has been used in several successful BIM projects around the world. Some examples are:

- The New International Airport of Mexico City (NAICM), a mega-project that involved the design and construction of a new airport with six runways, a terminal building, a control tower, and other facilities. Opus Planet was used to manage the cost estimation, budgeting, scheduling, and contracting of the project.[^1^]
- The Khan Academy Headquarters in Mountain View, California, a project that involved the renovation and expansion of an existing office building for the non-profit educational organization. Opus Planet was used to create a 3D model of the building and perform energy analysis and optimization.[^2^]
- The Bamboo U Campus in Bali, Indonesia, a project that involved the design and construction of a sustainable educational campus using bamboo as the main material. Opus Planet was used to create a digital twin of the campus and coordinate the fabrication and installation of the bamboo components.[^3^]

Opus Planet is a software that demonstrates how technology can enhance the performance and outcomes of construction projects. It is a software that can help users achieve their goals of delivering high-quality, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly buildings and infrastructure.
