If you love the look and feel of iOS but don't want to buy an Apple device, you can still enjoy the iOS experience on your Windows PC. All you need is a skin pack that can change the appearance of your Windows desktop, icons, taskbar, start menu, and more.
 
There are two skin packs that can transform your Windows 7 or 8 into iOS: iOS Skin Pack 3.0 for Windows 7 and iOS 6 Skin Pack 4.0 for Windows 8. These skin packs are created by Hamed Danger, a developer who has made many other skin packs for Windows.

Both skin packs are easy to install and uninstall. They also come with various features and options that let you customize your iOS theme. For example, you can choose between light or dark mode, enable or disable the dock, change the wallpaper, and more.
 
To download and install the skin packs, follow these steps:
 
1. Visit the official website of Hamed Danger at [https://skinpacks.com/](https://skinpacks.com/) and search for the skin pack that matches your Windows version.
2. Click on the download link and wait for the file to finish downloading. The file size is about 50 MB.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to restart your PC after the installation is complete.
4. Enjoy your new iOS theme on your Windows PC!

If you want to uninstall the skin pack, you can use the uninstaller that comes with it or go to Control Panel > Programs and Features and remove it from there.
 
Note: Before installing any skin pack, it is recommended to create a system restore point or backup your files in case something goes wrong. Also, some antivirus programs may detect the skin pack as a threat, but this is a false positive. You can ignore the warning or disable your antivirus temporarily while installing the skin pack.
  
The iOS skin packs are compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and 8. They also support Windows 11 and Windows 10. However, you should check the system requirements before installing them to avoid any issues.
