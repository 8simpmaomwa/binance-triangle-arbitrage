In this article, we will explain what Migration Tool is, how it works, and how you can use it to install your favorite FSX addons to Prepar3D.
 
## What is Migration Tool?
 
Migration Tool is a software developed by **Flightsim Estonia**, a company that specializes in creating tools and utilities for flight simulation. Migration Tool was first released in 2012 and has been updated regularly to support the latest versions of Prepar3D.
 
Migration Tool creates a virtual FSX installation, meaning that it will turn an empty folder of your choice into looking like FSX root folder, with all necessary configuration files present. Everything installed there - no matter if by hand or using installers - will appear in Prepar3D. Virtual FSX installation has numerous work-arounds helping installers and utilities find necessary files[^1^].
