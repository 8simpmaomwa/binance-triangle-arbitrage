The book was a surprise hit in 2001, quickly selling out its first run of 500 copies. [2] By 2013 it had sold over 240,000 copies, at which time a 12th anniversary edition was published. [2] The success of Bob Ong's book among Filipinos has been attributed to its conversational tone which uses humor to point out various absurdities inherent to Filipino culture. [3] The popularity of ABNKKBSNPLAko?! in particular is attributed to an element of nostalgia. [3]
 
The book is divided into eight chapters, each corresponding to a stage of the author's education: elementary school, high school, college, computer school, driving school, review center, and teaching. Each chapter contains anecdotes and reflections on the author's experiences as a student, such as his struggles with math, his crushes on girls, his encounters with bullies and teachers, his involvement in extracurricular activities, and his aspirations for the future. The book also touches on social issues such as poverty, corruption, violence, and colonial mentality.
 
The book is written in a casual and colloquial style, using slang words and expressions that are familiar to Filipinos. The author also makes frequent references to popular culture, such as movies, TV shows, comics, music, and celebrities. The book is filled with illustrations and photographs that complement the text. The book also contains quizzes, puzzles, and jokes that add to the fun and interactive nature of the book.
 
ABNKKBSNPLAko?! is not only a humorous and nostalgic autobiography but also a commentary on the Philippine educational system and society. The book challenges the readers to reflect on their own experiences as students and citizens, and to question the status quo. The book also celebrates the resilience and creativity of Filipinos who overcome difficulties and pursue their dreams.
