# How to Complete Quests with Console Commands in The Witcher 3
 
If you are playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, you may have encountered some bugs or glitches that prevent you from completing certain quests. For example, you may have found all the Witcher gear schematics but the quest still remains active, or you may be stuck on a dialogue option that does not advance the story. In such cases, you may want to use console commands to complete the quests and move on with your adventure.

Console commands are special codes that you can type in the debug console to alter various aspects of the game. You can enable the debug console by editing the general.ini file in your game folder and adding the line "DBGConsoleOn=true" at the bottom. Then, you can open and close the console by pressing the tilde key (~) in-game.
 
To complete quests with console commands, you will need to know two things: the quest ID and the fact ID. The quest ID is a unique identifier for each quest in the game, while the fact ID is a value that determines the state of the quest. You can find these IDs by searching online or using mods like Quest Debugger. Once you have them, you can use the command "addfact (quest ID)\_(fact ID)" to complete the quest. For example, if you want to complete the quest "Scavenger Hunt: Cat School Gear" with the quest ID "q302" and the fact ID "302\_state", you can type "addfact q302\_302\_state" in the console.

However, be careful when using console commands to complete quests, as they may have unintended consequences on your game. Some quests may require additional actions or world-state changes to complete properly, and some quests may affect other quests or characters later on. It is recommended that you backup your save files before using console commands, and only use them as a last resort.
  
Some of the most useful console commands for completing quests are:
 
- god - Toggles "god" mode on/off which allows invincibility.
- setlevel (level) - Sets character level to specific number.
- addmoney (amount) - Gives the character a specific amount of money (Crowns).
- likeaboss - Toggles "likeaboss" mode on/off which allows you to do 40% of your foes maximum health with each hit.
- testpause - Pauses the current game.
- testunpause - Unpauses the current game.

You can also use console commands to teleport to different locations in the game world. Some of the most common ones are:

- gotoWyzima - Teleports you to Vizima.
- gotoNovigrad - Teleports you to Novigrad.
- gotoSkellige - Teleports you to Skellige.
- xy (x, y) - Teleports you from the current map to the specified coordinates.

Console commands can be a great way to enhance your gaming experience and fix some annoying bugs in The Witcher 3. However, they can also break your game or make it too easy or boring. Use them wisely and sparingly, and always backup your save files before experimenting with them. Happy hunting!
