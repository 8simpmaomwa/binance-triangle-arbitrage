# How to Enhance Your FSX Graphics with ENB Series
 
If you are a fan of flight simulation games, you might be familiar with FSX, or Microsoft Flight Simulator X. This game allows you to fly various aircrafts in realistic scenarios and environments. However, you might also notice that the graphics of FSX are not very impressive, especially compared to newer games. Fortunately, there is a way to improve the visual quality of FSX without spending a lot of money or upgrading your hardware. All you need is a free mod called ENB Series.
 
ENB Series is a graphic modification for games that enhances the lighting, colors, shadows, reflections, and other effects. It works by injecting some code into the game's process and modifying the rendering engine. ENB Series can be customized for different games and preferences, and there are many presets available online created by users. One of them is ENB Series (FSX Ultra Realistic).exe, which aims to make FSX look more realistic and immersive.
