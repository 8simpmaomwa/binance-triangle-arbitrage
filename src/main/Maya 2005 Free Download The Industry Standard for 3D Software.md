# How to Get Maya 2005 for Free
 
If you are looking for a professional 3D software to create realistic characters and effects, you might be interested in Maya 2005. Maya is a powerful application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, and is used by many studios and artists in the entertainment industry. However, Maya is not cheap, and you might wonder if there is a way to get it for free.
 
The good news is that there is a way to get Maya 2005 for free, legally and ethically. Autodesk, the company that owns and develops Maya, offers a free trial version of the software for 30 days. You can download the trial version from their official website[^1^] [^2^] and use it for personal or educational purposes. The trial version has all the features and functionality of the full version, so you can explore and learn Maya without any limitations.

However, the bad news is that after 30 days, the trial version will expire and you will not be able to use it anymore. If you want to continue using Maya, you will have to buy a subscription or a perpetual license from Autodesk. The prices vary depending on the type and duration of the license, but they are usually quite expensive for individual users.
 
So, what can you do if you want to use Maya for longer than 30 days without paying? Well, there are some options, but they are not recommended or endorsed by Autodesk. One option is to use a crack or a keygen to bypass the activation process and make the trial version last forever. However, this is illegal and unethical, and it can also expose your computer to viruses and malware. Another option is to use an older version of Maya that is no longer supported by Autodesk, such as Maya 2005. However, this is also risky and problematic, as you might encounter compatibility issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and lack of updates.
