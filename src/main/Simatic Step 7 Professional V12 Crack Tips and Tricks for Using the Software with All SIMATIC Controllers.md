## Creating a Project
 
To start programming a SIMATIC controller, you need to create a project in SIMATIC STEP 7 Professional V12. A project contains all the data and settings for your automation task, such as devices, networks, hardware configuration, user program and communication.
 
To create a project, follow these steps:
 
1. Open SIMATIC STEP 7 Professional V12 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
2. Select "Create new project" from the Start screen or the File menu.
3. Enter a name and a description for your project and click "Create".
4. Select the devices and networks that you want to use in your project and click "Add". You can also drag and drop devices from the device catalog to the project tree.
5. Configure the hardware and communication settings for each device and network by double-clicking on them in the project tree.
6. Save your project by clicking "Save" or "Save as" from the File menu.

## Programming a Controller
 
After creating a project, you can program a controller using one or more of the following programming languages: Ladder Diagram (LAD), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Structured Text (SCL) or Statement List (STL). Each language has its own programming editor with optimized compilers and syntax highlighting.
 
To program a controller, follow these steps:

1. Select the controller that you want to program in the project tree.
2. Create a new block or open an existing block by right-clicking on the "Program blocks" folder and selecting "New" or "Open". A block is a reusable unit of code that contains logic or data for your user program.
3. Select the programming language that you want to use from the drop-down menu in the toolbar of the programming editor.
4. Enter your code in the programming editor. You can use new functions such as Calculate, EmptyBox, String Functions, DB change during running operation, etc. You can also use technological functions such as closed-loop or position control.
5. Save your block by clicking "Save" or "Save as" from the File menu.

## Testing and Debugging a User Program
 
After programming a controller, you can test and debug your user program using various tools in SIMATIC STEP 7 Professional V12. These tools include online/offline simulation, system diagnostics, variables trace and online watch tables.
 
To test and debug a user program, follow these steps:

1. Connect your controller to your PC via an Ethernet cable or a USB adapter.
2. Select the controller that you want to test or debug in the project tree.
3. Download your user program to the controller by clicking "Download to device" from the Online menu. You can also download individual blocks or data blocks by right-clicking on them and selecting "Download".
4. Switch to online mode by clicking "Go online" from the Online menu. You can now monitor and modify the status of your user program on the controller.
5. Use online/offline simulation to test your user program without affecting the actual process. You can simulate inputs and outputs, timers and counters, analog values, etc. You can also compare online and offline values by using online watch tables.
6. Use system diagnostics to detect and correct errors in your user program or hardware configuration. You can view diagnostic messages, error logs, device status, etc. You can also use system diagnostics as an integrated system function in your user program.
7. Use variables trace to record signals from your user program that runs on the controller.
