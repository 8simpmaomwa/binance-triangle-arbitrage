Taste is not a typical Korean movie that focuses on romance, comedy or action. It is a movie that delves into the dark and twisted side of human nature, where nothing is sacred and everything is for sale. The movie exposes the corruption and decadence of the wealthy elite, who use their money and power to manipulate and exploit others. The movie also shows the desperation and frustration of the lower class, who are willing to sacrifice their dignity and morality for a chance to escape their misery.
