1. Choose a suitable location for the central unit, preferably near an electrical outlet and a window. Avoid placing it near metal objects or electronic devices that may interfere with the wireless signal.
2. Use the drill and screws to mount the central unit on the wall or on a flat surface. Make sure it is stable and secure.
3. Insert the SIM card into the slot on the side of the central unit (if you want to use GSM communication). Make sure it is compatible with your network provider and has enough credit.
4. Connect the power adapter to the central unit and plug it into an electrical outlet. The central unit will beep and flash its LED lights to indicate that it is powered on.
5. Choose suitable locations for the sensors, depending on what type of protection you want. For example, you can place door/window sensors on entry points, motion sensors in hallways or rooms, smoke detectors near potential fire sources, gas detectors near gas appliances, etc.
6. Use the drill and screws to mount the sensors on the wall or on a flat surface. Make sure they are within range of the central unit (up to 100 meters in open space) and that they are not obstructed by anything.
7. Press and hold the learn button on each sensor until it beeps and flashes its LED light. This will pair it with the central unit. Repeat this process for all sensors.
8. Insert four AA batteries into the remote control. Press any button to test if it works. The central unit will beep and flash its LED lights to confirm that it has received a signal from the remote control.
9. Your WR 800 alarm system is now installed and ready to use.

## Usage

- To arm or disarm the system, press the lock or unlock button on the remote control. The central unit will beep and flash its LED lights to indicate that it has changed its status.
- To activate or deactivate a specific zone (such as home mode or away mode), press one of the zone buttons on the remote control. The central unit will beep and flash its LED lights to indicate that it has changed its status.
- To trigger an emergency alarm (such as panic, fire, or medical), press and hold one of the SOS buttons on the remote control. The central unit will beep loudly and flash its LED lights to alert you and anyone nearby. It will also send an SMS message to up to six preset phone numbers (if you have inserted a SIM card).
- To change any settings (such as volume, delay time, phone numbers, etc.), send an SMS command to the central unit using a specific format (see user manual for details). The central unit will reply with an SMS message to confirm that it has received and executed your command.
