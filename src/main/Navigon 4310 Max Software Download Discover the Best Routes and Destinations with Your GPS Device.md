# How to Update Your Navigon 4310 Max GPS Device with the Latest Software and Maps
  
If you own a Navigon 4310 Max GPS device, you may want to keep it updated with the latest software and maps to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. However, you may have encountered some difficulties or confusion in finding and installing the updates, especially since Navigon has discontinued its products and customer support as of December 1st, 2020[^3^]. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to update your Navigon 4310 Max GPS device with the latest software and maps, using a free program called Navigon Fresh and some alternative sources of upgrade files.
  
## What You Need
  
Before you start, make sure you have the following items:
 
**Download File âš™ [https://t.co/JO6TTjyPK2](https://t.co/JO6TTjyPK2)**


 
- A Navigon 4310 Max GPS device with a USB cable
- A Windows PC or a Mac with an internet connection
- A blank SD card (minimum 8 GB, maximum 16 GB) formatted in FAT32
- A backup of your Navigon device's files (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Download and Install Navigon Fresh
  
Navigon Fresh is a free program that allows you to update your Navigon device's software and maps, as well as manage its settings and purchase additional services and functions from the Fresh Shop. You can download Navigon Fresh from this link[^1^]. Choose the version that matches your operating system (Windows or Mac) and follow the instructions to install it on your computer.
  
## Step 2: Connect Your Navigon Device to Your Computer
  
Once you have installed Navigon Fresh, launch it and connect your Navigon device to your computer using the USB cable. Make sure your device is turned on and has enough battery power (at least 30 minutes). Navigon Fresh should recognize your device and display its model name and serial number on the screen. If not, try unplugging and replugging the USB cable, or restarting your computer or device.
  
## Step 3: Update Your Navigon Device's Software
  
Navigon Fresh will automatically check for available software updates for your device. If there are any updates, you will see a notification on the screen. Click on "Update now" to download and install the updates. This may take several minutes depending on your internet speed and the size of the updates. Do not disconnect your device or close Navigon Fresh during this process.
  
If there are no updates available, or if you want to upgrade your device's software to a newer version (such as from 21xx max to 4310 max), you will need to find and download the upgrade files from an alternative source. One possible source is this forum thread[^2^], where you can find links to various upgrade files for different Navigon models. However, use these files at your own risk, as they are not official or verified by Navigon. Make sure you read the installation guide carefully before proceeding.
